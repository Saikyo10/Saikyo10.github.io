                    <b>Call of Duty: Mobile</b> is a free-to-play first-person shooter video game developed by

                    on October 1, 2019, where it was one of the largest mobile game launches in history, 
                    generating over US$480 million with 270 million downloads within a year. Call of Duty: Mobile

                    Players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches in multiplayer mode. It has two types of 
                    in-game currencies: "Credits", which are earned through playing the game, and "COD Points", which 
                    are bought with real-world money. It is possible to play the full game without paying, though some 
                    exclusive character and weapon skins can only be bought with COD Points.[1] Apart from standard matchmaking,
                    a private room for both the multiplayer and battle royale modes can also be accessed where players can invite
                    and battle with their in-game friends.
