                    Players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches in multiplayer mode. It has two types of 
                    in-game currencies: "Credits", which are earned through playing the game, and "COD Points", which 
                    are bought with real-world money. It is possible to play the full game without paying, though some 
                    exclusive character and weapon skins can only be bought with COD Points.[1] Apart from standard matchmaking,
                    a private room for both the multiplayer and battle royale modes can also be accessed where players can invite
                    and battle with their in-game friends.
